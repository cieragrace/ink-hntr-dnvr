### Abstract - what I did
Living in Denver, I am well aware of the talent in the tattoo scene. Whether someone is new to Denver, trying to fins a new artist, or getting their very first tattoo; finding an artist can seem overwhelming. Even suggesting one to someone can be overehelming. In the app a user can use keywords to sort through top tier artists in the Denver area. All artists work out of shops with over 4.5 star google ratings. A user can also click on an artist name to see their shop info, link to their instagram and view a small collection of their work directly on the site. 

### Context:
I completed this app in 5 days. I had never written an API before, but for this project I did self study and succeed in building and implementing my own BE. I did set up responsiveness to ensure the app is accessable and easy to use on a tablet, phone or computer.
