### Abstract - what I did
Living in Denver, I am well aware of the talent in the tattoo scene. Whether someone is new to Denver, trying to fins a new artist, or getting their very first tattoo; finding an artist can seem overwhelming. Even suggesting one to someone can be overehelming. In the app a user can use keywords to sort through top tier artists in the Denver area. All artists work out of shops with over 4.5 star google ratings. A user can also click on an artist name to see their shop info, link to their instagram and view a small collection of their work directly on the site. 

### Context:
I completed this app in 5 days. I had never written an API before, but for this project I did self study and succeed in building and implementing my own BE. I did set up responsiveness to ensure the app is accessable and easy to use on a tablet, phone or computer. 

### Deployment Site
https://ink-hntr-dnvr.herokuapp.com/

### Preview of the App

### Installation Instructions
1. Go to [this repo] ('https://github.com/cieragrace/ink-hntr-dnvr') on Github
2. Click "Fork", then 'Create New Fork'
3. Click 'Code' and copy the SSH url provided by Github
4. In your terminal, navigate to the new project repository
5. Go into desired parent folder and type 'git clone' and paste the ssh url you copied
6. Cd into the repo directory and open in text editor
7. In terminal when in correct repo run 'npm install', 'npm start', then go to "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser
8. You will also need to clone down the API server. Go to [API repo] (https://github.com/cieragrace/ink-hntr-api) 
9. Clone into project directory, do not nest
10. Once cloned, npm install and then npm start and you will be able to access the data set

### Future Features
1. Add favoriting feature. Favorite button on artist page that will add artist card to favorites component
2. Update API to have profile photo for home page artist cards 
3. Update API to have shop address
4. Use google maps react API to link to shop address, create Links on address to take to map view
5. Beef up the data base, 30 artists was just for this MVP

### Wins and Challenges
Wins
1. Scraping data and building my own API and seeing the data come through the browser and in Postman was so satisfying
2. In 5 days I feel like I was able to get 80% of my vision to come to life
3. One of the firs people I walked through my app actually used it and saved an artists data, I already have had a user
Challenges
1. Hit a major time blocker pulling images from the BE data base due to saving img paths over URLs
2. Did not get all of the functionality I had planned in the 5 days
3. Not getting progile images to work was a big miss on my project. Did not plan out the API deep enough for that and they will not pull from the current images.
